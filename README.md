# AutoMates
Not Updating the code, fixes are welcome. I will try to merge your code as early as possible.

## Setup (Ubuntu)

Run the  command to install the only package needed `selenium`.  

- `sudo apt install python3-selenium`
- `git clone https://github.com/balivarun/Linkdin-Auto`
- `cd Automates`
- `python run.py`
- Just use the menu to do things.

This program is only supported on Python 3.10 and above.

### For adding new features/ideas, open a new issue [here](https://github.com/balivarun/Linkdin-Auto/issues/new).
